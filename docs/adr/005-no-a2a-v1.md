# ADR-005: No Agent-to-Agent Communication in v1

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-19

## Context

Google's A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol enables structured inter-agent communication. Our ops team has agents that could benefit from coordination (e.g. Watchman detecting an issue → Tribune triaging it).

## Decision

Skip A2A in v1. Agents communicate indirectly via shared state (K8s resources, AgentRun findings) and notification channels.

## Rationale

- **Complexity**: A2A adds protocol negotiation, discovery, and routing — significant implementation surface
- **Maturity**: A2A is early-stage; the protocol may change significantly
- **Sufficiency**: For v1, the escalation channel (`target: agent`) provides basic inter-agent signaling
- **Focus**: v1 priority is single-agent reliability, not multi-agent orchestration

## Consequences

- Agents cannot directly request actions from other agents
- Complex workflows require human orchestration or external automation
- A2A is planned for v2, informed by dogfooding experience with indirect coordination
