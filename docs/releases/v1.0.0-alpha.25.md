# v1.0.0-alpha.25 — Stage 3.6.4 guardrail docs + CI fast-fail workflow

## Highlights

### 1) Contributor-facing architecture guardrail workflow

- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guardrail preflight commands and exception escalation path.
- Expanded `docs/architecture/ci-boundary-guardrails.md` with:
  - local fast-fail/preflight commands
  - CI fast-fail behavior
  - common violation examples and fixes
  - explicit boundary exception process and required metadata.

### 2) CI fast-fail guardrail gate

- Added a dedicated CI preflight job (`make architecture-guard GO=go`) that runs before test/build/lint/e2e jobs.
- Updated workflow dependencies so expensive jobs are blocked when architecture guardrails fail.
- Added `make preflight` for local parity with CI-first architecture checks.

### 3) Enforced exception registry for intentional transitional edges

- Added exception registry file: `docs/contracts/architecture-boundary-exceptions.yaml`.
- Updated boundary contract metadata to Stage 3.6.4 and linked exception registry.
- Added compatibility test coverage to validate:
  - exception metadata completeness
  - reviewer sign-off + tracking issue presence
  - approval/expiry date validity
  - required coverage for transitional allow edges.

## Compatibility

- No API/MCP surface changes.
