# v1.0.0-alpha.26 — Stage 3.7.1 federation read model

## Highlights

### 1) Multi-source federation inventory read model

- Added read-model primitives in `internal/controlplane/fleet` for federation inventory aggregation:
  - `FederationSourceAdapter`
  - `FleetSourceAdapter`
  - `FederationStore`
- Added source-aware filtering support (`source`, `cluster`, `site`) plus passthrough inventory filters (`tag`, `status`).

### 2) Source attribution and health rollups

- Federated inventory records now include explicit source attribution (`source.id`, `source.name`, `source.kind`, `source.cluster`, `source.site`, `source.status`).
- Added per-source status rollups and an overall federation health rollup (`healthy`, `degraded`, `unavailable`, `unknown`).
- Added unavailable/partial data handling in rollup payloads.

### 3) Additive federation API surface

- Added read-only routes:
  - `GET /api/v1/federation/inventory`
  - `GET /api/v1/federation/summary`
- Existing write/mutation paths are unchanged.

## Compatibility

- [compat:additive] Added `GET /api/v1/federation/inventory` and `GET /api/v1/federation/summary` as read-only additive endpoints.
