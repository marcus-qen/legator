# v0.9.0 Release Checklist (Defense in Depth)

## Scope

This checklist covers release hardening/signoff for v0.9.0:
- P1 core safety primitives
- P2 policy intelligence + anomaly baseline
- P3 ChatOps safety + cross-surface parity

## Required evidence inventory

- P1.1–P1.4 reports (blast radius, per-user rate limit, typed confirmation, audit outcomes)
- P2.1–P2.4 reports (UserPolicy CRD, unified evaluator, anomaly baseline, policy simulation)
- P3.1 reports (Telegram MVP + live validation + RBAC deploy green)
- P3.2 reports (typed confirmation guardrails + closeout)
- P3.3 reports (parity kickoff + UI API-forwarding + closeout)

## Execution checklist

- [x] Safety-gate API path tests passing
- [x] ChatOps typed-confirmation tests passing
- [x] Dashboard approval action path API-forwarded (no direct mutation path)
- [x] Cross-surface parity suite reports `pass: true`
- [x] Release notes drafted (`RELEASE-NOTES-v0.9.0.md`)
- [x] Changelog candidate section present (`v0.9.0-rc1`)
- [x] Release readiness harness executed (`hack/v0.9-release-readiness.sh`)

## Gate matrix

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ChatOps safe operator workflows without bypass | PASS | P3.1 + P3.2 + P3.3 reports |
| Parity suite across CLI/API/UI/ChatOps | PASS | parity artifact with `pass: true` |
| Hardening checklist complete | PASS | this checklist + readiness harness output |
| v0.9.0 candidate signoff package assembled | PASS | release notes + changelog + reports |

## Candidate signoff

- **Decision:** FINAL SIGNOFF (GO)
- **Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Approver signal:** Keith explicit "go ahead" received in session; proceed with `v0.9.0` tag/publish.
