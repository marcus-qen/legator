# v1.0.0-alpha.23 — Stage 3.6.2 architecture import-graph guardrails

## Highlights

### 1) Automated architecture enforcement from boundary contract

- Added import-graph enforcement test: `internal/controlplane/compat/boundary_import_graph_test.go`.
- The test loads `docs/contracts/architecture-boundaries.yaml` as source of truth and:
  - lists repository Go packages via `go list -json ./...`
  - classifies packages into declared architecture boundaries using `package_patterns`
  - checks cross-boundary import edges against `dependency_policy`

### 2) CI fail-fast guardrails for boundary violations

- CI now fails when:
  - a package import matches an explicit deny edge (`dependency_policy.deny`), or
  - a cross-boundary edge is undeclared in `dependency_policy.allow` (default deny)
- Violation output is deterministic and includes:
  - source package + boundary
  - imported package + boundary
  - edge (`from->to`)
  - rule reference (`dependency_policy.deny[...]` or default-deny reference)

### 3) Local developer lint gate + docs refresh

- Added `make architecture-guard` for local pre-push checks.
- Wired architecture guardrail lint gate into `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
- Updated docs:
  - `docs/architecture/ci-boundary-guardrails.md`
  - `docs/contracts/architecture-boundaries.yaml`
  - `README.md`

## Compatibility

- No API/MCP surface changes.
