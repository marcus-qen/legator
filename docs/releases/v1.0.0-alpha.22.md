# v1.0.0-alpha.22 — Stage 3.6.1 architecture boundary contract

## Highlights

### 1) Boundary + ownership contract for CI guardrails

- Added machine-readable contract: `docs/contracts/architecture-boundaries.yaml`.
- Defined boundary zones for:
  - core domain
  - adapters/integrations
  - surfaces (HTTP, MCP, UI)
  - platform/runtime wiring
  - probe runtime
- Added default-deny dependency policy with explicit allow/deny edges.
- Added ownership assignments for each boundary and key module patterns.

### 2) Contract integrity tests in CI

- Added `internal/controlplane/compat/boundary_contract_test.go`.
- Tests validate:
  - contract schema/metadata presence
  - required boundary IDs and unique package patterns
  - dependency policy consistency and boundary references
  - ownership assignment completeness + owner validity
  - package pattern path resolution

### 3) Human documentation + rollout model

- Added guide: `docs/architecture/ci-boundary-guardrails.md`.
- Documented Stage 3.6.2 plan to enforce import-graph boundary rules from this contract.

## Compatibility

- No API/MCP surface changes.
