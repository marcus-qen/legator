# v1.0.0-alpha.21 — Stage 3.5 API/MCP compatibility contract

Release date: 2026-03-01

## Highlights

### 1) Formal compatibility/deprecation policy
- Added `docs/api-mcp-compatibility.md` covering:
  - REST + MCP versioning policy
  - additive vs breaking change rules
  - deprecation windows and removal process
  - required changelog/release-note annotations

### 2) CI-enforced contract guardrails
- Added append-only stable baselines under `docs/contracts/` for:
  - REST API routes
  - MCP tools
  - MCP resources
- Added deprecation registry (`docs/contracts/deprecations.json`).
- Added `internal/controlplane/compat/contracts_test.go` to fail CI on:
  - untracked additions to stable surfaces
  - undeclared removals/renames
  - malformed deprecation metadata

### 3) Documentation cross-linking
- Updated API/MCP-facing docs (`README.md`, `docs/grafana-adapter.md`, `docs/kubeflow-adapter.md`) to reference the compatibility contract.
- Added release-note rules in `docs/releases/README.md`.

## Compatibility
- [compat:additive] Added compatibility policy and contract enforcement checks.
- [compat:additive] No existing REST API route, MCP tool name, or MCP resource URI was removed or renamed.

## Validation checklist
- `go test ./...` ✅
- `make >/tmp/make.log && ./hack/e2e-test.sh` ✅

## Upgrade notes
- No runtime behavior changes.
- This release adds guardrails and process requirements for future API/MCP evolution.
