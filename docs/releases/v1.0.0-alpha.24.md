# v1.0.0-alpha.24 — Stage 3.6.3 guardrail remediation + baseline lock

## Highlights

### 1) Verified clean architecture guardrail state

- Ran Stage 3.6.2 boundary guardrails and confirmed there are no active violations to carry forward.
- Baseline lock was captured from a clean graph so future drift detection has low noise.

### 2) Added deterministic cross-boundary import baseline lock

- Added `internal/controlplane/compat/boundary_import_baseline_test.go`.
- The test computes package-level cross-boundary imports and compares them to:
  - `docs/contracts/architecture-cross-boundary-imports.txt`
- CI now fails with actionable output when:
  - new cross-boundary imports appear without review, or
  - stale baseline entries are left behind after refactors.

### 3) Added explicit baseline refresh workflow

- Added update mode for intentional architecture changes:

```bash
LEGATOR_UPDATE_ARCH_IMPORT_BASELINE=1 go test ./internal/controlplane/compat -run TestBoundaryContract_ImportGraphBaselineLock -count=1
```

- Updated `make architecture-guard` to run baseline lock checks.
- Updated architecture guardrails docs + contract metadata to Stage 3.6.3.

## Compatibility

- No API/MCP surface changes.
