# v1.0.0-alpha.34 — Stage 3.9.1 reliability scorecards

## Highlights

### 1) Additive reliability SLO/SLI model for core surfaces

Introduced an additive reliability scorecard contract covering:

- **control plane**: availability, p95 latency, error-rate
- **probe fleet**: connectivity, command success

Each indicator includes explainability metadata (thresholds, comparator semantics, sample-size context, and rationale strings).

### 2) New reliability scorecard API route

Added:

- `GET /api/v1/reliability/scorecard`

Optional query parameter:

- `window` (duration, default `15m`, capped at `24h`)

### 3) Additive fleet summary extension

`GET /api/v1/fleet/summary` now includes an additive `reliability` payload using the default scorecard window.

### 4) Telemetry-backed score computation (non-breaking)

Scorecards are computed from existing runtime telemetry/state:

- sampled control-plane HTTP request latency/status data,
- fleet probe connectivity state,
- recent `command.result` audit events.

No breaking API schema changes were introduced.

### 5) Tests/docs/contracts/UI updates

Added/updated:

- scorecard + request telemetry tests,
- server handler + permission tests for reliability route,
- route contract baseline updates,
- documentation (`docs/reliability-scorecards.md`, README/changelog updates),
- Fleet UI summary badge for current reliability score/status.

## Compatibility

- [compat:additive] Added `GET /api/v1/reliability/scorecard` and additive `reliability` response fields on `GET /api/v1/fleet/summary`.
